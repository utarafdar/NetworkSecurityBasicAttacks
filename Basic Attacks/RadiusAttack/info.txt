Information needed to carry the brute force attack.
1.	Network Traffic file 
2.	Access request authenticator value from the RADIUS : Access-Request packet
3.	The User-password attribute value from the RADIUS : Access-Request packet
4.	The user password.
5.	Dictionary of possible passwords.
 
“with UP = user password, K = shared secret, and RA = Request-Authenticator, B0 = MD5 (K || RA), C0 = B0 ? UP,  C0 is inserted in the RADIUS User-Password Attribute”
We already know the user password, we can get the values for RA and User-password attributes from the Network traffic file. With this information we can guess the value for shared key.
